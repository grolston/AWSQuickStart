# AWSQuickStart PowerShell Module

AWSQuickStart is a PowerShell module based on the AWS managed aws-quickstart repo [quickstart-microsoft-utilities](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-microsoft-utilities). The intent of the module is to deliver the entire `quickstart-microsoft-utilities` as a product that can be bootstrapped via PowerShell in a more native fashion.
